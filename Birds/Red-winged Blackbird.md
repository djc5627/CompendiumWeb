Red-winged black bird foraging by picnic site.

# **Notes**
Prefer to eat from the ground. Seen once or twice at bird feeder but not common. They have a very distinct "two-stage" call that we quickly became familiar with at Warinanco park. A lot of these tend to congregate at Jackson Pond portion of Rahway River Park.
