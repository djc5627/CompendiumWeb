Today I went to Rahway River Park during lunch. I saw there were many birds at my feeder and I figured it would be a good day for birding. It couldn't be worse than yesterday when I almost froze my hands off in 20-degree weather and saw almost no birds.

Immediately upon entering the park, I saw a bunch of [[Dark-eyed Junco|Dark-eyed Juncos]] and [[Mourning Dove|Mourning Doves]] near the parking lot. As I approached the lake I saw a large flock of [[Mallard Duck|Mallard Ducks]] and [[Canada Goose|Canada Geese]] swimming around. The Canada geese were actually using their beaks to pick pieces of ice from part of the lake's surface that was frozen.

After walking halfway around the lake, I saw a smaller duck with dark plumage which I assumed to be an [[American Black Duck]]. After zooming in with my camera, I realized it was actually a female [[Hooded Merganser]]! It was my second time seeing this species but my first time seeing the female. As expected, the male was close by. I ended up sitting at the edge of the lake for almost two hours taking photos. I tried to circle around the other side of the lake to get closer but the ducks would just move to the opposite side.

While I sat there taking photos, an older man was on a nearby bench. Eventually, the man came over and talked to me about how the city was planning to add a fountain to the lake like other nearby parks but never finished the effort. Apparently, this increases the available oxygen in the water which promotes healthy algae growth. Before heading back to the car, I showed the man photos of the Mergansers which he appreciated.

As I drove out of the parking lot, barely able to feel my hands from the cold, I saw a Hawk land in a nearby tree. I immediately pulled over to get photos. It ended up being a [[Red-Tailed Hawk]]. Luckily, it did not stay for long because at this point I couldn't feel my face either from the cold and I definitely would have stayed longer.
