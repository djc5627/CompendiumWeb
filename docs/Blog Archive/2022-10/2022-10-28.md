## Bald Eagle Over Jackson Pond
2022-10-28

This morning I was torn between going back to Hawk Rise Sanctuary and going to a different location. I ended up flipping a coin which ended in me going to Rahway River Park's Jackson Pond. The morning started quietly with few birds but the fall colors inspired me to switch to my wide-angle lens and get some shots of the pond. 

After getting some wide-angle shots I decided to move further up the pond where some [[Mallard Duck|Mallard Ducks]] were hanging out. After a while, I saw a large bird flying high up in the sky. After switching my camera to my birds-in-flight mode, I realized it was a [[Bald Eagle]]! This was my second time ever seeing one, but my first time seeing one this close. I was able to get some great shots of them in flight which will make a great compendium thumbnail. To think a coin flip was what led me here today.
