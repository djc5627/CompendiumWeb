Today I went to Central Park with some friends to explore and take photos. We decided to visit Central Park since the weather was nice (60 degrees) and the fall colors were in full bloom. While crossing Bow Bridge, I saw a [[Red-Tailed Hawk]] fly overhead and got some cool shots. I think I startled the people around me when I yelled "Red-Tailed Hawk!" and pointed at the sky. 

The Ramble at Central Park is a well-known birding spot and the number of people carrying large lenses supports that. We saw a group of photographers gathering to photograph a [[Great Horned Owl]]. I tried to get some shots but the owl was in dark shadow with the sun behind them. All around the Ramble there were [[Tufted Titmouse|Tufted Titmice]]. I hadn't seen a titmouse since my trip to Boston last year. I was surprised to see them all around foraging on the ground. I'd love to visit Central Park more often and get to know some of the photographers that frequent it.
