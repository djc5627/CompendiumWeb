I couldn't resist heading back to Milton Lake Park this morning in search of another [[Hooded Merganser]]. I woke up, immediately drank coffee, and headed out. I was quickly greeted by a cacophony of screeches coming from a flock of [[Grackle|Grackles]] above, one of the many signs that winter is coming. Along the path I saw a bunch of [[Dark-eyed Junco|Dark-eyed Juncos]] and [[White-throated Sparrow|White-throated Sparrows]]. I also talked to a jogger who asked me about my camera and mentioned he travels to the city for people photography.

Unfortunately, I did not see any [[Hooded Merganser|Hooded Mergansers]] at Milton Lake and it was time to head back home for work. On the walk back, I heard a loud shrill bark and was face-to-face with two Red Foxes whose faces were covered in blood. It definitely caught me by surprise but I knew they are virtually harmless to humans. They quickly turned around and ran to the nearby cemetery. I wasn't fast enough to ready my camera at the moment but I think that experience woke me up more than my morning coffee. 

Upon getting home, I was opening the door to our deck to leave food for a stray cat that visits us when I saw a [[Merlin]] perched on our deck. I slowly backed off from the door and was able to get some photos through the glass door. This was my first time photographing a [[Merlin]], he was probably camping out our birding waiting for small birds.

Later in the afternoon, I decided to go back and harvest the Lion's Mane mushroom I found yesterday. After researching it online, I learned it's a great beginner mushroom to forage because it's only got one look-a-like which is also edible. I also posted pictures of it on Reddit to see what others thought and it was confirmed as Lion's Mane. Harvesting it was actually really easy, I basically just grabbed it gently and rocked it back and forth as I peeled it off the tree. It was squishy and wet and I left the fruiting body behind in hopes that it will grow again. Tonight, I will try making a stir fry with the mushroom! Oh, and I also saw a male [[Wood Duck]] at the lake!
