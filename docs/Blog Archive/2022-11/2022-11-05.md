This weekend, some of my college friends and I got together at Penn State for a reunion we planned. It has been over 4 years since we graduated and most of us had not been back to State College. I was excited to see my friends and catch up. It was also a good opportunity to bring my camera and see Penn State from a photographer's perspective. During my years at Penn State, I did not own a camera or know much of anything much about birds.

After a long drive and some catching up yesterday, we decided to explore the campus today. The weather was cloudy with rain on and off but at some points, the sun shone through the clouds. Regardless, I was surprised to see how many photo opportunities came up in just the short walk we did. My friend spotted a [[Red-Tailed Hawk]] soaring over the campus and I was able to get some in-flight shots. I was also surprised to see how many birds were around the Duck Pond. We saw [[American Robin|American Robins]], a [[White-breasted Nuthatch]], various sparrows, and more. There was also a turtle relaxing on a rock in the Duck Pond. I also let my friend use my camera so he could get a feel for what photography was like. 

It was a very cool experience going back to my college campus after so many years and with a different perspective. One of the things I love about photography is how it adds a whole new layer of interest and wonder even to places I had visited so many times in the past. I'm excited to revisit Penn State during our next reunion and discover even more.
