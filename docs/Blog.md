Today my sister and I went to the Bergen County Bald Eagle Festival. I heard about this festival from a flier that a close friend gave me the prior week. I wasn't too sure what to expect since it was also the first time the event was held. I was surprised to see a lot of people at the event, at least 60 people from children to older adults. The event was also very organized and well set up.

## Prone for Pipers at Sandy Hook

Today, my sister and I decided to wake up early to go birding at Sandy Hook. It was very a cold morning (~10 degrees) and it had rained days prior so it wasn't surprising to see snow and ice at Sandy Hook. What we didn't expect was that a big chunk of the beach would be coated in ice. It was interesting sliding across ice while also seeing sand and the ocean which are usually associated with much warmer weather.

This past week, I went birding at Milton Lake Park just about every morning and afternoon. At this time of year, the sun's arc in the sky provides great lighting across the park from about 8 am to 3 pm. Instead of making several blog posts, I'll try to summarize them into one post.

This morning, my sister and I went to Rahway River Park for birding. I was hoping to see some [[Hooded Merganser|Hooded Mergansers]] and maybe some new ducks at the lake. As soon as we parked the car, my sister pointed out some [[Turkey Vulture|Turkey Vultures]] flying low along the tree line. I immediately grabbed my camera, set it to a faster shutter, and got some crisp shots of the Vultures.

Today I went to Rahway River Park during lunch. I saw there were many birds at my feeder and I figured it would be a good day for birding. It couldn't be worse than yesterday when I almost froze my hands off in 20-degree weather and saw almost no birds.

## Shovelers and Hand-feeding Titmice at Central Park

After stuffing ourselves with multiple Thanksgiving meals these past few days (leftovers included), we decided to take advantage of the unusually nice weather in November (50 and sunny) and choose to take a day trip to New York City. We planned to do birding at Central Park and after seeing multiple posts on the Manhattan Birds Twitter account of people hand-feeding birds there, I also packed bird feed and peanuts.

## Fungal Foraging, Foxes, and Sharpie Sighting

I couldn't resist heading back to Milton Lake Park this morning in search of another [[Hooded Merganser]]. I woke up, immediately drank coffee, and headed out. I was quickly greeted by a cacophony of screeches coming from a flock of [[Common Grackle|Grackles]] above, one of the many signs that winter is coming. Along the path I saw a bunch of [[Dark-eyed Junco|Dark-eyed Juncos]] and [[White-throated Sparrow|White-throated Sparrows]]. I also talked to a jogger who asked me about my camera and mentioned he travels to the city for people photography.

After eating way too much for breakfast, I felt like I needed to go for a walk. I decided to head over to Milton Lake Park and bring my camera since I had not gone birding there in a while. Milton Lake Park consists of a walking path that goes alongside the Hazel Wood Cemetery and Middlesex Reservoir which eventually becomes Milton Lake. The area is fairly secluded compared to the nearby Esposito Park but dense foliage makes birding difficult at times.

## Penn State Birding

This weekend, some of my college friends and I got together at Penn State for a reunion we planned. It has been over 4 years since we graduated and most of us had not been back to State College. I was excited to see my friends and catch up. It was also a good opportunity to bring my camera and see Penn State from a photographer's perspective. During my years at Penn State, I did not own a camera or know much of anything much about birds.

## Halloween Hike Ravens

Today I went on a Halloween hike with my sister at Harriman State Park. We decided to revisit a trail from last year, Seven Hills Loop, because we wanted something challenging and this one had scrambling. The motivation for the hike was that my sister had not been to our favorite Japanese restaurant near Harriman State Park since last Halloween, and we couldn't let it be more than a year without pork buns.

## Titmice at Central Park

![[DSC01213_1.jpg]]{ .blogItem .blogRow1 data-title="Tufted Titmouse foraging on the ground at Central Park"}

Today I went to Central Park with some friends to explore and take photos. We decided to visit Central Park since the weather was nice (60 degrees) and the fall colors were in full bloom. While crossing Bow Bridge, I saw a [[Red-Tailed Hawk]] fly overhead and got some cool shots. I think I startled the people around me when I yelled "Red-Tailed Hawk!" and pointed at the sky.

## Bald Eagle Over Jackson Pond

![[DSC01019_1.jpg]]{ .blogItem .blogRow2 data-title="Jackson Pond"}

This morning I was torn between going back to Hawk Rise Sanctuary and going to a different location. I ended up flipping a coin which ended in me going to Rahway River Park's Jackson Pond. The morning started quietly with few birds but the fall colors inspired me to switch to my wide-angle lens and get some shots of the pond.

I went to Hawk Rise Sanctuary this morning before work. It was a cool fall morning with no clouds in the sky. The leaves are almost all turned to their fall colors but still mostly on the trees. This time, I brought my wide-angle lens to get shots of the landscape as well.

## Sandy Hook Overrun by Mockingbirds

We went back to Sandy Hook today early in the morning with the help of some espresso. It was a cloudy day with some drizzling that wasn't ideal for photos but I was too excited to go back. This time we decided to walk around the shore before going to Plum Island where we saw large groups of gulls alongside fishermen. You can see New York City from the shore and I got some interesting shots of fishermen with the city behind them.

Today we went birding at Sandy Hook for the first time. We decided to try out the location because I saw the NJ Audubon Society was having a birding tour there earlier in the day and figured it must be a good location. The tour started at parking lot B near Plum Island so I assumed that island is where the birding took place.
