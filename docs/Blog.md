I couldn't resist heading back to Milton Lake Park this morning in search of another [[Hooded Merganser]]. I woke up, immediately drank coffee, and headed out. I was quickly greeted by a cacophony of screeches coming from a flock of [[Grackle|Grackles]] above, one of the many signs that winter is coming. Along the path I saw a bunch of [[Dark-eyed Junco|Dark-eyed Juncos]] and [[White-throated Sparrow|White-throated Sparrows]]. I also talked to a jogger who asked me about my camera and mentioned he travels to the city for people photography.

After eating way too much for breakfast, I felt like I needed to go for a walk. I decided to head over to Milton Lake Park and bring my camera since I had not gone birding there in a while. Milton Lake Park consists of a walking path that goes alongside the Hazel Wood Cemetery and Middlesex Reservoir which eventually becomes Milton Lake. The area is fairly secluded compared to the nearby Esposito Park but dense foliage makes birding difficult at times.

This weekend, some of my college friends and I got together at Penn State for a reunion we planned. It has been over 4 years since we graduated and most of us had not been back to State College. I was excited to see my friends and catch up. It was also a good opportunity to bring my camera and see Penn State from a photographer's perspective. During my years at Penn State, I did not own a camera or know much of anything much about birds.

## Halloween Hike Ravens

Today I went on a Halloween hike with my sister at Harriman State Park. We decided to revisit a trail from last year, Seven Hills Loop, because we wanted something challenging and this one had scrambling. The motivation for the hike was that my sister had not been to our favorite Japanese restaurant near Harriman State Park since last Halloween, and we couldn't let it be more than a year without pork buns.

## Titmice at Central Park

Today I went to Central Park with some friends to explore and take photos. We decided to visit Central Park since the weather was nice (60 degrees) and the fall colors were in full bloom. While crossing Bow Bridge, I saw a [[Red-Tailed Hawk]] fly overhead and got some cool shots. I think I startled the people around me when I yelled "Red-Tailed Hawk!" and pointed at the sky.

## Bald Eagle Over Jackson Pond

This morning I was torn between going back to Hawk Rise Sanctuary and going to a different location. I ended up flipping a coin which ended in me going to Rahway River Park's Jackson Pond. The morning started quietly with few birds but the fall colors inspired me to switch to my wide-angle lens and get some shots of the pond.

I went to Hawk Rise Sanctuary this morning before work. It was a cool fall morning with no clouds in the sky. The leaves are almost all turned to their fall colors but still mostly on the trees. This time, I brought my wide-angle lens to get shots of the landscape as well.

We went back to Sandy Hook today early in the morning with the help of some espresso. It was a cloudy day with some drizzling that wasn't ideal for photos but I was too excited to go back. This time we decided to walk around the shore before going to Plum Island where we saw large groups of gulls alongside fishermen. You can see New York City from the shore and I got some interesting shots of fishermen with the city behind them.

Today we went birding at Sandy Hook for the first time. We decided to try out the location because I saw the NJ Audubon Society was having a birding tour there earlier in the day and figured it must be a good location. The tour started at parking lot B near Plum Island so I assumed that island is where the birding took place.
