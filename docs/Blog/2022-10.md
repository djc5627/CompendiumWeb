Today we went birding at Sandy Hook for the first time. We decided to try out the location because I saw the NJ Audubon Society was having a birding tour there earlier in the day and figured it must be a good location. The tour started at parking lot B near Plum Island so I assumed that island is where the birding took place. 

I've been to this same beach at Sandy Hook so many times as kid and never thought I would be going there for birding. The location is a mix of sandy shores, marshes, and shrubs/small trees. The sandy shores attract gulls and shore birds while the marshy area attracts herons. The shrubs were covered in song birds including sparrows, mockingbirds, and yellow-rumped warblers. This intersection of many biomes makes a really good birding spot. 

I saw/photographed a [[Black-crowned Night Heron]] (in-flight) and an [[Eastern Towhee]] for the first time. [[Yellow-rumped Warbler]]s dominated the shrubs during this fall migration. Also met another photographer that helped me identify the Black-crowned Night Heron who we thought was actually an American Bittern. We were disappointed to hear that but excited to add another bird to our compendium. We are very excited to re-visit this location and explore the rest of Sandy Hook! Probably going back tomorrow morning haha.

We went back to Sandy Hook today early in the morning with the help of some espresso. It was a cloudy day with some drizzling that wasn't ideal for photos but I was too excited to go back. This time we decided to walk around the shore before going to Plum Island where we saw large groups of gulls alongside fishermen. You can see New York City from the shore and I got some interesting shots of fishermen with the city behind them.

Today the parking lot was overrun by [[Northern Mockingbird]]s, saw at least 30 of them making their persistent noisy calls. Plum Island had plenty of [[Yellow-rumped Warbler]]s but I was disappointed to not find the [[Eastern Towhee]] rummaging through the brush like yesterday. We saw a [[Great Egret]] and two [[Great Blue Heron]]s on Plum Island's shore but they flew away before we got within photo range (wearing all black probably isn't the best beach camo). We also some some [[Red-winged Blackbird]]s wearing their non-breading plumage. It was odd seeing them quiet without their distinct Spring-time calls. Similarly my favorite sparrow, the [[White-throated Sparrow]], wasn't singing their Spring-time song but I always love seeing them. Excited to come back with better weather!
