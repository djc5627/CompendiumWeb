## Notes

While often mistaken for ducks, Coots are actually part of the Rail (Rallidae) family of ground-living birds that are only distantly related to ducks. Coots don't have webbed feet like ducks and instead have a long toe with broad lobes of skin that help it kick through water. They have a notably short beak with a basal knob on their forehead.
