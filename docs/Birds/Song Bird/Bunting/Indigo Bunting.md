## Notes
First seen at Harriman State park at the top of a mountain and mistaken for a juvenile [[Brown-headed Cowbird]] since the juvenile Indigo Bunting looks similar. However, the vibrant blue plumage differed from that of the cowbird. Like all other blue birds, their feathers aren't actually blue. Instead, their feathers have microscopic structures that refract blue light similar to those that make the sky blue.
