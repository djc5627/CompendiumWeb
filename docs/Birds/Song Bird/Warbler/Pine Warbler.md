*Pine Warbler at Natirar Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Natirar Park. The Pine Warbler is the only warbler that eats large quantities of seeds, primarily those of pines. This seed-eating ability means Pine Warblers sometimes visit bird feeders, unlike almost all other warblers.
