## Notes

First seen at Rahway River Park during winter. Chances are we had seen this bird previously but confused them for a [[Common Grackle]] since they tend to travel together in flocks. Rusty blackbirds molt once per year from their rust-colored winter plumage to their smooth black/gray breeding plumage. Rusty blackbird are one of North America's most rapidly declining species. The population plunged 85-99% over the past 40 years and scientists are puzzled as to why.
