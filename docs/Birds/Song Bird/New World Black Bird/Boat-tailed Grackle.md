*Boat-tailed Grackle savaging for food at Cape May*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Cape May during Osprey Boat Tour. Very similar to [[Great-tailed Grackle]] and [[Common Grackle]] but thrive in saltwater marshes. They also sport a much larger tail.
