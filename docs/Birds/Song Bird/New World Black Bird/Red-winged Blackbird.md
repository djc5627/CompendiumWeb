## Notes
Prefer to eat from the ground. Seen once or twice at bird feeder but not common. They have a very distinct "two-stage" call that we quickly became familiar with at Warinanco park. A lot of these tend to congregate at Jackson Pond portion of Rahway River Park as well as Hawk Rise Sanctuary. They seem to really like wide-open marshy areas with tall grass.
