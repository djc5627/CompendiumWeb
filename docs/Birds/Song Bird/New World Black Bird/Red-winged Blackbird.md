*Red-winged Blackbird squawking at Best Lake in Watchung*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
Prefer to eat from the ground. Seen in flocks at bird feeder but not common. They have a very distinct "two-stage" call that we quickly became familiar with at Warinanco park. A lot of these tend to congregate at Jackson Pond portion of Rahway River Park as well as Hawk Rise Sanctuary and Great Swamp. They seem to really like wide-open marshy areas with tall grass.
