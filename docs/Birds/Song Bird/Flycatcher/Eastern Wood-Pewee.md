## Notes
Tiny bird known for its distinct "pee-a-wee" call. First seen on a nature/birding walk at NJ Audubon's wildlife sanctuary. Later, photographed at Hawk Rise Sanctuary. Pewees tend to land on a branch then repeated fly around and land back on that same branch. This made the small bird easier for photograph.
