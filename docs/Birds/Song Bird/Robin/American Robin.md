*Robin (puffed up) eating berries from holly tree outside our house during snowfall*

## Notes
Often seen at home and Esposito Park. They walk in short bursts instead of hopping to get around when grounded. Winter of 2022 they invaded the holly tree in front of our house to eat the red berries during snowfall. There were about 20 robins at the holly tree eating for about 5 hours. They were extremely comfortable and let me get very close to them. Oreo jumped at the glass door a few times and scared them but they came right back. When its cold, they puff up to almost twice their normal width and I thought they were different type of Robin.
