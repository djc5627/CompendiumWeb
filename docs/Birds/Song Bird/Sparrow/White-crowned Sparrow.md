*White-crowned Sparrow on a broken fence at Hawk Rise Sanctuary*

## Notes

First seen at Hawk Rise Sanctuary during fall migration. Photographed on a fence by the Hark Rise Lookout. At first thought it was a Field Sparrow but the darker head streaks as well as less prominent white eye ring gave it away. Immature White-crowned Sparrows look fairly similar to field sparrows. Young males learned the basics of their song during the first 2 or 3 months of its life.
