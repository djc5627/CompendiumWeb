---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Hawk Rise Sanctuary during fall migration. Savanah sparrows look like a combination of the streaky [[Song Sparrow]] and the yellow-browed [[Swamp Sparrow]]. Often seen around marshes and swamps jumping between tall grasses. They are named Savannah Sparrows because the species was identified in Savannah, Georgia.
