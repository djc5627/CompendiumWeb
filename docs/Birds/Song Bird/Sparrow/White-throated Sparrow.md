*White-throated Sparrow on log at Hawk Rise Sanctuary*

## Notes
From far away, assumed they were a [[House Sparrow]] or [[Song Sparrow]], not until zoomed in that I saw they had yellow brows. I wonder how many we had mistaken for more common sparrows. Very distinct call that is heard all around during Spring.
