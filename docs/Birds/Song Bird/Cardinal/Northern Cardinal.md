## Notes
Cardinals have a large tuft on their head that they can collapse. The male is much brighter than the female who has muted red-brown colors and orange beak. Cardinals prefer larger feeders because they feel safer when grounded by their large tail feathers. We often see a cardinal couple at our feeders and nearby bushes. They will carry shelled peanuts with their beaks back to their nest.
