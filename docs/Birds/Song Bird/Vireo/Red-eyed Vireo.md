*Red-eyed Vireo on a branch at Treman State Park where it was feeding a Brown-headed Cowbird*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
First seen at Treman State Park in NY feeding another bird that was much larger. Soon realized that it was feeding the parasitic ![[Brown-headed Cowbird]] who was almost twice the size of the Vireo.
