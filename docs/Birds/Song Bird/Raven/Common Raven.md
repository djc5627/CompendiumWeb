*Common Raven Soaring mountain peak at Harriman State Park*

## Notes

First seen at Harriman State Park Seven Loops Trail on Halloween weekend. Ravens look very similar to [[American Crow|American Crows]] but are much larger. After climbing to the top of mountain, we saw a groups of large black birds flying around. At first thought they were [[Turkey Vulture|Turkey Vultures]] based on their size but then realized they were Ravens. It felt very fitting to see them for the first time on Halloween weekend.
