## Notes

An aggressive defender of its nest, the Brown Thrasher is known to strike people and dogs hard enough to draw blood. Brown Thrashers are accomplished songsters that may sing more than 1,100 different song types and include imitations of other birds, including Chuck-willâ€™s-widows, [[Wood Thrush]], and [[Northern Flicker]].
