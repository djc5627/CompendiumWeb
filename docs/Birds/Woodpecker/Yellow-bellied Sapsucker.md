## Notes

First seen at Milton Lake Park while I was doing macro photography. The photo was taken with my macro lens as I could not pass up on the opportunity. This sapsucker looks similar to the [[Downy Woodpecker]] and [[Hairy Woodpecker]] but with red throat and more speckled black and white plumage.
