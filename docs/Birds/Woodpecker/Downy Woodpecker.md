*Downy Woodpecker in our front yard during snowfall (same day American Robins were in our holly tree eating berries).*


---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
Seen often at our bird feeder eating suet. Often flies to nearby dead tree in neighbor's yard. Not to be confused with [[Hairy Woodpecker]] who is about 9 inches long while hairy is only 6.5 inches long. Hairy also has a longer beak then Downy (about twice as long). Scientists think the Downy Woodpecker evolved to look like its larger cousin to avoid conflict while feeding.

Fun fact: Woodpeckers can wrap their tongues around their brain to protect against high-speed pecking.
