*Pileated Woodpecker on a tree at Rahway River Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
First seen on a nature walk at Scherman Hoffman Wildlife Sanctuary but not photographed until later date at Rahway River Park. Largest woodpecker we have seen. Its pecking is much lower in frequency than smaller woodpeckers but with much great force. We saw chips of tree bark fly off the tree as it rammed its head into the bark.
