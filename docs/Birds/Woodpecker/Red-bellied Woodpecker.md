*Red-bellied Woodpecker at Esposito Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
Sometimes seen at our bird feeder or large dead tree in neighbor's yard. Been a while since we seen him at our feeder, seen more often around summer of 2021. Otherwise, a fairly common woodpecker spotted easily at parks with taller trees.

Fun fact: Woodpeckers can wrap their tongues around their brain to protect against high-speed pecking.
