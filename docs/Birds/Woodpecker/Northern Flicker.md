## Notes
Not seen too often at our house. Sometime confuse him for the [[Red-bellied Woodpecker]] who actually has zebra-style pattern instead of these dots. Northern Flicker's dotted pattern reminds me of lantern flies.

Fun fact: Woodpeckers can wrap their tongues around their brain to protect against high-speed pecking.
