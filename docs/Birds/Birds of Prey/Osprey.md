*Osprey soaring over Bradley Beach*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
Circle around their prey similar to the [[Turkey Vulture]]. Instead of waiting for prey to die, they swoop in with their large talons and attempt to catch the prey. Seen catching fish out of the water at Bradley Beach. Also seen Osprey being chased by [[Red-winged Blackbird]], most likely protecting its nest.
