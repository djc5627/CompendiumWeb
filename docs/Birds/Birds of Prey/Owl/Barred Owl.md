## Notes
First seen at Great Swamp Refuge on 4th of July 2022. For weeks there were 2 adults and 1 fledging right by the Observation Center. Many photographers came each day to get pictures of the owls. The owls were definitely not shy and weren't bothered by all the people. One day, saw the owl try to attack a ground hog but the ground hog shoo'd the owl away.
