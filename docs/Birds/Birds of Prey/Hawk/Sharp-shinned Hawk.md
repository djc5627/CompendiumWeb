*Sharp-shinned Hawk on my backyard deck*

## Notes

First sighting was on our backyard deck early in the morning. A relatively small hawk that looks very similar to a [[Cooper's Hawk]]. A good way to tell them apart is that a Cooper's Hawk is "wearing a hat" while the Sharp-shinned Hawk has continuous head to back plumage.
