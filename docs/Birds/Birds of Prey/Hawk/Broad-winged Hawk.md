## Notes

First spotted at Tamaques Park as I was pulling into the parking lot. After parking I immediately went back to tree line where I saw the hawk. After a few minutes, two Broad-winged Hawks swooped from one tree to another and I was able to get a photo. These hawks are much smaller and compact then [[Red-Tailed Hawk]]s. Broad-winged Hawks leave the northern forests in Fall and can be seen in flocks of thousands called "kettles", often observed at hawkwatch sites.
