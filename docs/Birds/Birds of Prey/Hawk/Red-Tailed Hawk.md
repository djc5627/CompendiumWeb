*Red-Tailed hawk on a branch in an industrial part of Boston.*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes
Saw for the fist time at Boston. Their eyes look very human-like. Also seen at Warinanco Park. Was surprised to find that hawk seen at Warinanco Park was a Red-Tailed Hawk as well, their appearance can vary a lot.
