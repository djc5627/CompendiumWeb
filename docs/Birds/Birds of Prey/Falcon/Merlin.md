## Notes

First seen in my backyard overlooking our bird feeder. Merlins are fierce falcons that use surprise attacks to take down small songbirds and shorebirds. They have adapted to life around town and cities. Merlins don't build their own nests, they take over the old nests of other raptors or crows. Merlins are heavier and a bit larger than the more common [[American Kestrel]].
