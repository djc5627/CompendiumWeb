## Notes

First seen at Hawk Rise Sanctuary perched on a fence around the landfill. Similar in size to a Merlin but with colorful plumage. Kestrels hunt insects and other small prey. Fun fact, Kestrels as well as other birds, can see ultraviolet light which enables them to make out trails of urine that prey mammals leave behind.
