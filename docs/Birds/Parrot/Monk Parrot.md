## Notes

First seen at Secaucus Greenway. Monk Parrots are not native to New Jersey and are actually escaped domestic pets that have bred and survived in the NJ wild. Originally from South America. Monk Parakeets can live 6 years or more in the wild, and in captivity often live as long as 15 years.
