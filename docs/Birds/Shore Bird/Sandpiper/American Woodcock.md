*Woodcock hiding in bushes at Bryant Park*

## Notes

First seen at Bryant Park in NYC. That day, there was a lone Woodcock in a busy being observed by other photographers. It was in the same spot for hours without moving much except blinking and the occasional bobbing. Woodcocks have a long beak that is optimal for probing the ground for other worms and insects. Their eyes close to the back of their head so they can watch out for predators while probing the ground for food. Woodcocks make a buzzing *peent* call.
