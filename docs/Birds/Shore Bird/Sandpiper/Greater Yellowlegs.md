*Great Yellowlegs satisfying an itch at Mill Creek Mark Trail*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Mill Creek Marsh Trial during Spring migration of 2023. They seem to like the low tide at this location which makes foraging for food easy. Looks very similar to the [[Lesser Yellowlegs]] but a bit taller and with a longer, wider bill.
