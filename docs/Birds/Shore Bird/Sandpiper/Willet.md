*Willet having a snack at FortDesoto in Florida*

## Notes

First seen at Tampa Bay in Florida foraging on the sandbar during the sunrise. They stood out to me because they were more than twice the size as [[Sanderling|Sanderlings]]. These pipers have a long bill and even longer legs with big knees. Like [[Killdeer]], Willets will pretend to be disabled by a broken wing in order to draw attention to themselves and lure predators away from their eggs or chicks.
