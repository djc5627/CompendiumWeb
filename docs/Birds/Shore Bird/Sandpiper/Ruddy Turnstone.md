*Ruddy Turnstone with a dirty beak at FortDesoto in Florida*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at FortDesoto in Florida in large numbers near [[Piping Plover|Piping Plovers]]. Breeding males have patterned black-and-white heads and chest that make them easy to spot. Ruddy Turnstones have special feet that are somewhat spiny, with short, sharply curved toenails that help them hold on to slippery ground.
