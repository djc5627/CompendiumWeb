*Black-bellied Plover at FortDesoto in Florida*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at the Tampa Bay during sunrise collecting food on the sandbar. In breeding plumage, Black-bellied Plovers are a dazzling mix of snow white and jet black, accented by checkerboard wings. The largest and heaviest of North American plovers, Black-bellied is also the hardiest, breeding farther north than other species, at the very top of the world.
