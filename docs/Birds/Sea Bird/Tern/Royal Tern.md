*Royal Terns inspecting each other at FortDesoto in Florida*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at FortDeSoto in Florida in large numbers. Nonbreeding adults look like they are balding and breeding adults have a slick back hair as if they were hit with a powerful gust of wind. Chicks leave the nest within 1 day.
