## Notes
Small birds seen as the shore of beaches. They move their feet very quickly in a funny way. Travel in small packs and collectively avoid any incoming threats or people. Can be seen using their beaks to pick at the sand at edge of tide's reach. Funny to watch then foraging and then sprint back when the tide comes.
