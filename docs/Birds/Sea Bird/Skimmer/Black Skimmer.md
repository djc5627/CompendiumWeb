*Black Skimmer at FortDesoto in Florida*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at FortDesoto in Florida. This bird stood out to me due to their massive beaks with oversized lower mandibles. If you look closely, they also have ridged marking on their lower bill. Skimmers feed by opening the bill and dropping the long, narrow lower mandible into the water, skimming along until they feel a fish. Then they relax the neck, quickly closing their jaws and whipping the fish out of the water. Because they feed by essentially by touch, they can even forage at night. The worldâ€™s three species of skimmers are the only birds on earth that feed in this manner.
