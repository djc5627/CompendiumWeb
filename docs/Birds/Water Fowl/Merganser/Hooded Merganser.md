## Notes

First seen at Milton Lake Park. The Hooded Merganser is surprisingly tiny, about 65% the size of a [[Mallard Duck]]. The male is easy to spot with their black and white plumage and crescent-shaped head. Seen swimming fairly close to [[Mallard Duck|Mallard Ducks]]. They seem fairly sensitive to noise and keep their distance from humans.
