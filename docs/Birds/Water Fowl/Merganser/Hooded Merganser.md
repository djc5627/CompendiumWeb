*Hooded Merganser at Milton Lake Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Milton Lake Park. The Hooded Merganser is surprisingly tiny, a bit more than half the size of a [[Mallard Duck]]. The male is easy to spot with their black and white plumage and crescent-shaped head. Mergansers are brood parasites like the [[Brown-headed Cowbird]] which means they lay their eggs in other bird's nests. They nest in tree cavities; the ducklings depart with a bold leap to the forest floor when only one day old. Seen swimming fairly close to [[Mallard Duck|Mallard Ducks]]. They seem fairly sensitive to noise and keep their distance from humans.
