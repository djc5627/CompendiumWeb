*Common Merganser at DeKorte Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at DeKorte Park in the winter after the Bergan County Bald Eagle Festival. Common Mergansers are diving ducks with sleek plumage. The word "merganser" comes from Latin and roughly translates to "plunging goose". Gulls often circle mergansers while they dive for fish and try to steal their catch once they resurface. Mergansers nest in tree cavities left by woodpeckers and young chicks take a plunge of faith from the nest after just 1 day.
