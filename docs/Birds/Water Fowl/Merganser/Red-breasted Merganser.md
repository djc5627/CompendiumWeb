*Red-breasted Merganser at Sandy Hook*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Sandy Hook in the winter. Red-breasted Mergansers sport an impressive hair do. They are also diving ducks that eat about 15-20 fish per day. This suggests they need to dive underwater 250-300 times a day (~4-5hr of foraging a day) to meet their energy needs. Look similar to the [[Common Merganser]].
