*Green-winged Teal at the Great Swamp Refuge*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at the Great Swamp Refuge swimming in the Great Brook and photographed from the observation deck. The smallest dabbling duck in North America. The male has a cinnamon-colored head with a gleaming green crescent that extends from the eye to the back of the head. In flight, both sexes flash deep-green wing patches (specula).
