*American Black Duck swimming at Rahway River Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at Rahway River Park. Look very similar to the [[Mallard Duck]] but with darker brown chocolate colored plumage. They often hybridize with Mallards and their offspring's plumage has both green and brown.
