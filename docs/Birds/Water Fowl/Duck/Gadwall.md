*Gadwall showing of red patch at DeKorte Park*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at DeKorte Park in the winter after the Bergan County Bald Eagle Festival. Look very similar to the [[Mallard Duck]] but with a more blocky, square head and a red patch instead of blue. They often steal food from diving ducks as they rise to the surface (as close to a pirate duck as one can get). The males also make a hilarious [*MEEP* sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaSk24DhUjc).
