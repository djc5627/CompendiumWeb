## Notes

First seen at DeKorte Park near a flock of [[Gadwall|Gadwalls]] and [[Mallard Duck|Mallards]] during the winter. This lone duck stood out due to its smaller size and different color patterns but it was hard to identify because it had its face tucked back. Once the duck started moving and the beak/face was more visible, we identified it as a Ruddy Duck. This Ruddy Duck appeared to have an injured beak that was bent back a bit but otherwise seemed just fine. Ruddy Duck males stand out with their bright blue beaks. Ruddy Ducks are very aggressive toward each other and toward other species, especially during the breeding season. They are even known to chase rabbits feeding on the shore.
