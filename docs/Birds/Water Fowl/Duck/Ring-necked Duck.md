*Ring-necked Ducks at Violet Cury Nature Preserve in Florida*

## Notes

First seen at Rahway River Park in the winter. We were not able to observe them for long since they quickly flew away in a flock. During fall migration, they can form massive flocks of several hundred thousand as they congregate in Minnesota to eat wild rice.
