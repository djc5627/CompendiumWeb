## Notes

First seen at Central Park NYC at The Lake near The Ramble. Seen swimming in large flocks similar to [[Mallard Duck|Mallard Ducks]] but with their heads down as they swim. This is because their shovel-like bills have comb-like projections along its edges which filter out tiny crustaceans and seeds from the water. The females look similar to Mallard Duck females but the males look different than their Mallard counterparts and sport a bright yellow eye.
