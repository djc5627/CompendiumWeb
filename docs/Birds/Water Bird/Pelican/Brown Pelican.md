*Brown Pelican at FortDesoto in Florida*

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Notes

First seen at FortDesoto in Florida where several pelicans where flying around and plunge-diving for fish. These pelicans have a massive bill with a large expanding pouch for collecting fish. While the Brown Pelican is draining the water from its bill after a dive, gulls often try to steal the fish right out of its pouch
