## Notes
First seen flying over pond at Ernest L. Oros Wildlife Preserve. At fist thought it was a young [[Great Blue Heron]]. Green Herons can extend their necks a lot and puff their tufts. Fun fact, Green Herons are one of the few tool-using bird species. They often create fishing lures using bread crusts, insects, and feathers, dropping them on the surface to entice small fish.
