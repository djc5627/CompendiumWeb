*White Ibis pruning its feathers at Lettuce Lake in St Petersburg Florida*

## Notes

A common wetland bird in Florida with white feathers and a curved red beak. Seen nesting in trees in large numbers at Lettuce Lake. Their plumage and distinct silhouette makes then easy to spot. Male ibises are super protective and only leave the female alone at night. Ibises are bone with straight beaks and it's not until 14 days old that their beak starts to curve.
