*Reddish Egret charging and stirring up sediment to catch fish at FortDesoto beach in Florida*

## Notes

Perhaps the most interesting bird I seen so far. They race back and forth, open and shut their wings, stir up sediment with their feet, and even swoop low over the water in flightâ€”all in pursuit of small fish. This act can sometimes look like a complex dance and other times like a small dinosaur charging. There is a rare all-white morph of the Reddish Egret.
