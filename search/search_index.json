I decided to go two days early before the festival started so I could explore the area and go hiking/birding with my cousin. This was my first time going to Florida so I was very excited. The night before my flight, there was the first major snowfall of the year in New Jersey (~4 inches) and I was up until 1am making a massive snowman with my sister.

Last summer, we discovered Woodcocks and their hilarious bobbing behavior while watching funny YouTube videos, where one can see them bob to music . We immediately checked where Woodcocks could be found in our area and, to our surprise, discovered that they could be seen at Bryant Park in NYC. Apparently, birders know this park as \"Doodletown\" because the migratory bird arrives in large numbers starting in March. We decided that this warm winter day (~60 degrees) was the perfect time to visit. We also checked eBird the day before to confirm recent Woodcocks sightings at the park.</p> <p>Continue Reading</p>"},{"location":"Blog/#eagle-fest-and-dekorte-park-ducks","title":"Eagle Fest and DeKorte Park Ducks","text":"<p>2023-01-16</p> <p> </p> <p>Today my sister and I went to the Bergen County Bald Eagle Festival.

I decided to head over to Milton Lake Park and bring my camera since I had not gone birding there in a while. Milton Lake Park consists of a walking path that goes alongside the Hazel Wood Cemetery and Middlesex Reservoir which eventually becomes Milton Lake.

We decided to try out the location because I saw the NJ Audubon Society was having a birding tour there earlier in the day and figured it must be a good location. The tour started at parking lot B near Plum Island so I assumed that island is where the birding took place. </p> <p>I've been to this same beach at Sandy Hook so many times as a kid and never thought I would be going there for birding. The location is a mix of sandy shores, marshes, and shrubs/small trees. The sandy shores attract gulls and shore birds while the marshy area attracts herons. The shrubs were covered in song birds including sparrows, mockingbirds, and yellow-rumped warblers. This intersection of many biomes makes a really good birding spot. </p> <p>I saw/photographed a Black-crowned Night Heron (in-flight) and an Eastern Towhee for the first time. Yellow-rumped Warblers dominated the shrubs during this fall migration. Also met another photographer that helped me identify the Black-crowned Night Heron who we thought was actually an American Bittern. We were disappointed to hear that but excited to add another bird to our compendium. We are very excited to revisit this location and explore the rest of Sandy Hook! Probably going back tomorrow morning haha.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-22/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/SandyHook-NJ</p> <ul> <li>Black-crowned Night Heron</li> <li>Eastern Towhee</li> <li>Swamp Sparrow</li> <li>Savannah Sparrow</li> <li>Great Blue Heron</li> <li>Herring Gull</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>Yellow-rumped Warbler</li> <li>Northern Mockingbird</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-23/","title":"2022 10 23","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-23/#sandy-hook-overrun-by-mockingbirds","title":"Sandy Hook Overrun by Mockingbirds","text":"<p>2022-10-23</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>We went back to Sandy Hook today early in the morning with the help of some espresso. It was a cloudy day with some drizzling that wasn't ideal for photos but I was too excited to go back. This time we decided to walk around the shore before going to Plum Island where we saw large groups of gulls alongside fishermen. You can see New York City from the shore and I got some interesting shots of fishermen with the city behind them.</p> <p>Today the parking lot was overrun by Northern Mockingbirds, we saw at least 30 of them making their persistent noisy calls. Plum Island had plenty of Yellow-rumped Warblers but I was disappointed to not find the Eastern Towhee rummaging through the brush like yesterday. We saw a Great Egret and two Great Blue Herons on Plum Island's shore but they flew away before we got within photo range (wearing all black probably isn't the best beach camo). We also saw some Red-winged Blackbirds wearing their non-breading plumage. It was odd seeing them quiet without their distinct Springtime calls. Similarly, my favorite sparrow, the White-throated Sparrow, wasn't singing their Spring-time song but I always love seeing them. Excited to come back with better weather!</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-23/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/SandyHook-NJ</p> <ul> <li>Swamp Sparrow</li> <li>Great Blue Heron</li> <li>Great Egret</li> <li>Herring Gull</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>Yellow-rumped Warbler</li> <li>Northern Mockingbird</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Red-winged Blackbird</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>Marsh Wren</li> <li>House Finch</li> <li>Northern Mockingbird</li> <li>American Crow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-27/","title":"2022 10 27","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-27/#kestrel-and-kingfisher-at-hawk-rise-sanctuary","title":"Kestrel and Kingfisher at Hawk Rise Sanctuary","text":"<p>2022-10-27</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>I went to Hawk Rise Sanctuary this morning before work. It was a cool fall morning with no clouds in the sky. The leaves are almost all turned to their fall colors but still mostly on the trees. This time, I brought my wide-angle lens to get shots of the landscape as well.</p> <p>Upon entering Hawk Rise, I was not greeted with a flock of Yellow-rumped Warblers like the previous times this Fall, instead, it was actually quiet with few birds. I decided to switch to my wide-angle lens and get some cool shots of the sanctuary from the observation deck. The wind was whistling and the ocean of marsh reeds was swaying with it.</p> <p>I thought this would stay a fairly quiet morning until I saw some Red-Tailed Hawks flying overhead. Soon after, I saw a bird hovering over the Rahway River's banks and decided to take a burst of photos. To my surprise, the hovering bird was a Belted Kingfisher! This was my second time ever photographing one.</p> <p>Thinking that would be the highlight of the birding trip, I started to head back to the car when I saw a bird perched on a fence high atop Hawk Rise's hill. The bird was larger than the sparrows and finches of Hawk Rise but smaller than a hawk. After zooming with my camera, I noticed it was a new bird I hadn't photographed before. I immediately ran up the hill when it sat atop the fence to get better shots. Later, I discovered it was an American Kestrel! The shots I got could have been better because I was far away and the lighting was harsh. This makes me excited to go back and try to get better photos! But for now, I am equally excited to add a new entry to our compendium.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-27/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/HawkRiseSanctuary-Linden-NJ </p> <ul> <li>American Kestrel</li> <li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li> <li>American Goldfinch</li> <li>Swamp Sparrow</li> <li>Yellow-rumped Warbler</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>Herring Gull</li> <li>Great Egret</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-28/","title":"2022 10 28","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-28/#bald-eagle-over-jackson-pond","title":"Bald Eagle Over Jackson Pond","text":"<p>2022-10-28</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>This morning I was torn between going back to Hawk Rise Sanctuary and going to a different location.

We decided to revisit a trail from last year, Seven Hills Loop, because we wanted something challenging and this one had scrambling. The motivation for the hike was that my sister had not been to our favorite Japanese restaurant near Harriman State Park since last Halloween, and we couldn't let it be more than a year without pork buns.</p> <p>The weather was very pleasant around 60 degrees and sunny. Throughout the hike, we saw Dark-eyed Juncos, American Robins, and others. However, these sorts of dense forests isn't usually the best place for birding since dense foliage makes it difficult to get clean shots. From our last hike here, I remember seeing a bunch of Turkey Vultures at the peak of the mountain. Last time we approached too quickly and startled them, but this time I was ready and approached slowly. </p> <p>Upon reaching the peak, we were instead greeted by a group of 10 Common Ravens flying around. At first, I thought they were American Crows but realized they were much larger. I switched my camera to my preset for tracking birds in flight and got some good shots of the Ravens. The mountain peak itself is a beautiful vantage point so I switched to my wide-angle lens and got some cool landscape shots.</p> <p>After the hike, we found out the restaurant was very busy and the chances of getting a table without reservations were slim. We were disappointed that we didn't get to eat pork buns and sushi but we were glad it motivated this awesome hike.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-10/2022-10-30/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/HarrimanStatePark </p> <ul> <li>Common Raven</li> <li>Turkey Vulture</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> <li>American Robin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-05/","title":"2022 11 05","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-05/#penn-state-birding","title":"Penn State Birding","text":"<p>2022-11-05</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>This weekend, some of my college friends and I got together at Penn State for a reunion we planned. It has been over 4 years since we graduated and most of us had not been back to State College. I was excited to see my friends and catch up. It was also a good opportunity to bring my camera and see Penn State from a photographer's perspective. During my years at Penn State, I did not own a camera or know much of anything much about birds.</p> <p>After a long drive and some catching up yesterday, we decided to explore the campus today. The weather was cloudy with rain on and off but at some points, the sun shone through the clouds. Regardless, I was surprised to see how many photo opportunities came up in just the short walk we did. My friend spotted a Red-Tailed Hawk soaring over the campus and I was able to get some in-flight shots. I was also surprised to see how many birds were around the Duck Pond. We saw American Robins, a White-breasted Nuthatch, various sparrows, and more. There was also a turtle relaxing on a rock in the Duck Pond. I also let my friend use my camera so he could get a feel for what photography was like. </p> <p>It was a very cool experience going back to my college campus after so many years and with a different perspective. One of the things I love about photography is how it adds a whole new layer of interest and wonder even to places I had visited so many times in the past.

I decided to head over to Milton Lake Park and bring my camera since I had not gone birding there in a while. Milton Lake Park consists of a walking path that goes alongside the Hazel Wood Cemetery and Middlesex Reservoir which eventually becomes Milton Lake. The area is fairly secluded compared to the nearby Esposito Park but dense foliage makes birding difficult at times.</p> <p>The walk at Milton started off pretty slow with few birds and not many photo opportunities. I was surprised to find that there were Tufted Titmice foraging on the ground here, I had never seen them in this area before. As I approached Milton Lake, I noticed something growing on the side of a tree. As I got closer, I realized it was some type of mushroom that looked kind of like a sea anemone's tendrils. I examined the mushroom for a bit and took some photos to ID it later (it turned out to be Lion's Mane, an edible mushroom!).</p> <p>When I got to Milton Lake, I saw the usual Mallard Ducks and Canada Geese. As I started to turn around and head home, I noticed a duck close by that looked different. Before I could react, it saw me and flew away towards the other side of the lake but luckily not too far. I quickly grabbed my camera and took some photos. I immediately recognized the duck as a Hooded Merganser because just earlier in the day, I saw a post on Twitter about them being sighted at Central Park. Seeing one today was the last thing I expected! I love their crescent-shaped head and how funny they look when they are facing you. To my surprise, they were smaller than a Mallard Duck. I will definitely be visiting Milton Lake again to look for more species of duck!</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-08/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/MiltonLakePark-Clark-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Hooded Merganser</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>Canada Goose</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>Tufted Titmouse</li> <li>White-breasted Nuthatch</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-09/","title":"2022 11 09","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-09/#fungal-foraging-foxes-and-sharpie-sighting","title":"Fungal Foraging, Foxes, and Sharpie Sighting","text":"<p>2022-11-09</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>I couldn't resist heading back to Milton Lake Park this morning in search of another Hooded Merganser. I woke up, immediately drank coffee, and headed out. I was quickly greeted by a cacophony of screeches coming from a flock of Grackles above, one of the many signs that winter is coming. Along the path I saw a bunch of Dark-eyed Juncos and White-throated Sparrows. I also talked to a jogger who asked me about my camera and mentioned he travels to the city for people photography.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I did not see any Hooded Mergansers at Milton Lake and it was time to head back home for work. On the walk back, I heard a loud shrill bark and was face-to-face with two Red Foxes whose faces were covered in blood. It definitely caught me by surprise but I knew they are virtually harmless to humans. They quickly turned around and ran to the nearby cemetery. I wasn't fast enough to ready my camera at the moment but I think that experience woke me up more than my morning coffee. </p> <p>Upon getting home, I was opening the door to our deck to leave food for a stray cat that visits us when I saw a Sharp-shinned Hawk perched on our deck. I slowly backed off from the door and was able to get some photos through the glass door. This was my first time photographing a Sharp-shinned Hawk, he was probably camping out our birding waiting for small birds.</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, I decided to go back and harvest the Lion's Mane mushroom I found yesterday. After researching it online, I learned it's a great beginner mushroom to forage because it's only got one look-a-like which is also edible. I also posted pictures of it on Reddit to see what others thought and it was confirmed as Lion's Mane. Harvesting it was actually really easy, I basically just grabbed it gently and rocked it back and forth as I peeled it off the tree. It was squishy and wet and I left the fruiting body behind in hopes that it will grow again. Tonight, I will try making a stir fry with the mushroom! Oh, and I also saw a male Wood Duck at the lake!</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-09/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/MiltonLakePark-Clark-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> <li>Wood Duck</li> <li>Downy Woodpecker</li> <li>Red-bellied Woodpecker</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/Home-Clark-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Sharp-shinned Hawk</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-26/","title":"2022 11 26","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-26/#shovelers-and-hand-feeding-titmice-at-central-park","title":"Shovelers and Hand-feeding Titmice at Central Park","text":"<p>2022-11-26</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>After stuffing ourselves with multiple Thanksgiving meals these past few days (leftovers included), we decided to take advantage of the unusually nice weather in November (50 and sunny) and choose to take a day trip to New York City. We planned to do birding at Central Park and after seeing multiple posts on the Manhattan Birds Twitter account of people hand-feeding birds there, I also packed bird feed and peanuts.</p> <p>We started our adventure in NYC with a pastrami sandwich from Lenwich as well as a caffeine and sugar overdose from a coffee and black and white cookie. Probably not the best meal to have before walking over 7 miles but it worked out.  Our first stop at Central Park was The Lake near The Ramble. Here we saw some ducks that looked like Mallard Ducks but had their heads down in the water as they swam in circles. When one of them emerged from the water, we quickly realized it was a different species of duck due to their differently shaped bills and colored plumage called Northern Shovelers. The female looks similar to Mallards but the male has a bright yellow eye and molting immatures look spotty (and kind of funny).</p> <p>Our next stop was a location I had pinned on Google Maps from my previous visits which had several bird feeders set up among the trees. Near the feeders, we found a bench where someone had put a bunch of bird feed on the ground as well as peanut butter on smaller tree branches. The area was full of birds and squirrels scrambling to feed. Here we took out the bird feed and held out our hands. In seconds we had Tufted Titmice, Black-capped Chickadees, and even a House Sparrow land and eat from our hands. We didn't expect it to be so easy!</p> <p>We ended up sitting on those benches hand feeding birds for the next two hours. Many people walked by us, including a birding tour group, and were surprised by the birds eating from our hands. One couple that walked by seemed very amazed and I offered the lady some bird feed so she could try while her partner got a picture. Within seconds, a Tufted Titmouse landed on her hand and she said it was like a dream come true and thanked us. Later, a man walked by with a child who was trying to hand feed a bird with a piece of corn he picked up. The man jokingly said he only had a minute to wait before he had to walk him back to his parents. But a Tufted Titmouse landed on his hand in just a few seconds and ate the corn.</p> <p>After two hours on that bench, we didn't even feel like we were in the city anymore. We decided that was probably enough and walked to another bird feeder setup in The Ramble where we saw a crown of people observing a Barred Owl high up in the trees. We hand-fed some more birds here for a bit and then went to Times Square to explore and get some food. We will definitely be going back to Central Park to hand-feed birds when the Spring migration brings in new species.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-11/2022-11-26/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/CentralPark-NYC </p> <ul> <li>Northern Shoveler</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>Canada Goose</li> <li>Carolina Wren</li> <li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li> <li>Barred Owl</li> <li>Tufted Titmouse</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Black-capped Chickadee</li> <li>Downy Woodpecker</li> <li>Mourning Dove</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> <li>Rock Pigeon</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>White-breasted Nuthatch</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-14/","title":"2022 12 14","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-14/#merganser-couple-at-rahway-river-park","title":"Merganser Couple at Rahway River Park","text":"<p>2022-12-14</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>Today I went to Rahway River Park during lunch. I saw there were many birds at my feeder and I figured it would be a good day for birding. It couldn't be worse than yesterday when I almost froze my hands off in 20-degree weather and saw almost no birds.</p> <p>Immediately upon entering the park, I saw a bunch of Dark-eyed Juncos and Mourning Doves near the parking lot. As I approached the lake I saw a large flock of Mallard Ducks and Canada Geese swimming around. The Canada geese were actually using their beaks to pick pieces of ice from part of the lake's surface that was frozen.</p> <p>After walking halfway around the lake, I saw a smaller duck with dark plumage which I assumed to be an American Black Duck. After zooming in with my camera, I realized it was actually a female Hooded Merganser! It was my second time seeing this species but my first time seeing the female. As expected, the male was close by. I ended up sitting at the edge of the lake for almost two hours taking photos. I tried to circle around the other side of the lake to get closer but the ducks would just move to the opposite side.</p> <p>While I sat there taking photos, an older man was on a nearby bench. Eventually, the man came over and talked to me about how the city was planning to add a fountain to the lake like other nearby parks but never finished the effort. Apparently, this increases the available oxygen in the water which promotes healthy algae growth. Before heading back to the car, I showed the man photos of the Mergansers which he appreciated.</p> <p>As I drove out of the parking lot, barely able to feel my hands from the cold, I saw a Hawk land in a nearby tree. I immediately pulled over to get photos. It ended up being a Red-Tailed Hawk. Luckily, it did not stay for long because at this point I couldn't feel my face either from the cold and I definitely would have stayed longer.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-14/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/RahwayRiverPark-Rahway-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Hooded Merganser</li> <li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> <li>Downy Woodpecker</li> <li>Canada Goose</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>White-breasted Nuthatch</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-18/","title":"2022 12 18","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-18/#snow-goose-and-vultures-at-rahway-river-park","title":"Snow Goose and Vultures at Rahway River Park","text":"<p>2022-12-18</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>This morning, my sister and I went to Rahway River Park for birding. I was hoping to see some Hooded Mergansers and maybe some new ducks at the lake. As soon as we parked the car, my sister pointed out some Turkey Vultures flying low along the tree line. I immediately grabbed my camera, set it to a faster shutter, and got some crisp shots of the Vultures.</p> <p>At first, we only saw Canada Geese and Mallard Ducks. After a while, we noticed a different-looking duck and I got some quick photos. At the same time, an older man walked by and started talking to us. He apologized for interrupting and I did not want to be rude even though we just saw a new type of duck. We talked to him about photography and birding and he mentioned he makes Cyanotype prints. He said as he and his wife get older, they are getting more into birding (I guess we are already old LOL).</p> <p>After that discussion, we circled the lake in search of the duck but instead found several Hooded Mergansers who captured my attention for a long while. Eventually, we found the new duck again, which turned out to be a female Snow Goose. The female is actually gray-brown, and only the male sports a cinnamon-red head (as is usually the case in birds). We noticed the Snow Goose actually had an injured leg once she walked out of the lake. Luckily, she was still able to walk and fly.</p> <p>We were glad to find not only Hooded Mergansers but also to see a Snow Goose.

At this time of year, the sun's arc in the sky provides great lighting across the park from about 8 am to 3 pm. Instead of making several blog posts, I'll try to summarize them into one post.</p> <p>One (very cold) morning, I saw a Great Blue Heron on the bank of the river. He let me get very close and I ended up sitting across the water from him for over an hour. I got tons of photos and eventually, three deer came up to inspect him. The heron squawked at the deer when they got too close and they ran away. I also got to see the heron contort his long neck to scratch an itch on his back and side (always amazes me how well they articulate their necks).</p> <p>Another morning, I heard a bunch of Belted Kingfishers flying just above the lake. This small bird is often hard to spot when stationary but makes a loud chirping sound as they fly over water looking for fish. I sat for over an hour trying to get a photo of a kingfisher in flight but no luck (they really don't like people).</p> <p>Most mornings, I greet a jogger who is also a photographer. I also met someone who was walking their dog and spoke to him about the wildlife at the park. The man mentioned he is actually the person the town hires to kill off deer when their populations get too high. Another day, I ran into a friend I had met at Esposito Park in the summer and followed on Instagram. He noticed my new birding lens (Sony 200-600 G) and I checked out his new Nikon Z9 camera.</p> <p>One afternoon, I saw a Fox Sparrow which I had not photographed before. They look similar to Chipping Sparrows and American Tree Sparrows but with more red streaks on their undersides. Another afternoon, I saw a Hermit Thrush, who I also had not photographed before, hopping around on a fence. I was excited to add both new entries to the compendium.</p> <p>Another afternoon I saw a Red Fox walking along the cemetery trail. I was surprised the Red Fox did not run away as I walked nearby on the trail. After a while, I noticed there was a mostly eaten rotisserie chicken and carrots on the side of the trail (Thanksgiving leftovers?). I figured someone had left that there for the wildlife and the Red Fox was waiting to get the meal. That was definitely the case because the fox grabbed the chicken in its mouth and ran away as soon as I walked further down the trail.</p> <p>Throughout my visits to the park this week, I observed several Northern Cardinals picking petals from high up in the trees. It seems they pick the petals, eat the seeds, and drop the rest of the petals. I was wondering why so many petals were falling around me.</p> <p>This past week of birding made me realize Milton Lake Park is actually a great location both for observing wildlife and nature walks. Last year, when I had just gotten my camera, I thought the park did not have much to offer. My first impression was that it was unkept and limited with barely marked paths that can get muddy and overgrown. I was comparing it to the more maintained and suburbanized Esposito Park next door which offers sports fields and paved paths. Now that I am more experienced, I realize this makes for a relatively secluded exceptional birding location. I'm lucky that such a location is only a short walk away and I'm excited to see what else I'll discover there!</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-20/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/MiltonLakePark-Clark-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Fox Sparrow</li> <li>Hermit Thrush</li> <li>American Robin</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> <li>Mourning Dove</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>Canada Goose</li> <li>Hooded Merganser</li> <li>Northern Mockingbird</li> <li>Tufted Titmouse</li> <li>Downy Woodpecker</li> <li>Red-bellied Woodpecker</li> <li>Northern Flicker</li> <li>Carolina Wren</li> <li>Belted Kingfisher</li> <li>Common Raven</li> <li>American Crow</li> <li>Cooper's Hawk</li> <li>Turkey Vulture</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>White-breasted Nuthatch</li> <li>Pileated Woodpecker</li> <li>American Robin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-26/","title":"2022 12 26","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-26/#prone-for-pipers-at-sandy-hook","title":"Prone for Pipers at Sandy Hook","text":"<p>2022-12-26</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>Today, my sister and I decided to wake up early to go birding at Sandy Hook. It was very a cold morning (~10 degrees) and it had rained days prior so it wasn't surprising to see snow and ice at Sandy Hook. What we didn't expect was that a big chunk of the beach would be coated in ice. It was interesting sliding across ice while also seeing sand and the ocean which are usually associated with much warmer weather.</p> <p>After sliding across the frozen sand, we reached the ocean where we saw a bunch of Sandpipers running along the water's edge. I spent a good bit of time prone on the cold sand getting pictures of the Sandpipers, who we later identified to be Sanderlings. Once we came close to freezing, we headed back to the car to warm up and go the opposite way to Plum Island.</p> <p>The shore at Plum Island was so frozen that a large portion of the water had become slush. It was really interesting hearing the slushy waves crash against the sand but this also brought very cold winds. There was also a flock of gulls that would hover over the slushy waters and then swoop down to peck the slush. Floating the deeper waters, which had not become slush, we saw a bunch of ducks. We photographed two new ducks which we later identified as a Brant and Red-breasted Merganser.</p> <p>Later, we decided to explore the northern part of Sandy Hook near the former army base, Fort Hancock. Further north past the fort, there is a pond called Salt Pond where birders report many sightings. On the way to the pond, my sister found a yellow feather on the ground which Reddit helped us identify as a Northern Flicker feather. Unfortunately, when we got there, the pond was frozen as expected but we did get a great view of NYC from the northern shore.</p> <p>Throughout this birding trip we were surprised to see how many people were at Sandy Hook despite the extremely cold weather. I guess the locals know there's still plenty to experience there in the winter (and they are used to the cold ocean winds). We did not think there would be much to find at a beach during winter but we were pleasantly surprised.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2022-12/2022-12-26/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/SandyHook-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Sanderling</li> <li>Red-breasted Merganser</li> <li>Brant</li> <li>Savannah Sparrow</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Great Blue Heron</li> <li>Northern Mockingbird</li> <li>Hermit Thrush</li> <li>Yellow-rumped Warbler</li> <li>Herring Gull</li> <li>Ring-billed Gull</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>American Black Duck</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-01/2023-01-16/","title":"2023 01 16","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-01/2023-01-16/#eagle-fest-and-dekorte-park-ducks","title":"Eagle Fest and DeKorte Park Ducks","text":"<p>2023-01-16</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>Today my sister and I went to the Bergen County Bald Eagle Festival. I heard about this festival from a flier that a close friend gave me the prior week. I wasn't too sure what to expect since it was also the first time the event was held. I was surprised to see a lot of people at the event, at least 60 people from children to older adults. The event was also very organized and well set up.</p> <p>Upon arriving, we walked towards a group of people standing near viewing scopes. We spoke to one of the event organizers (who turned out to be the president of the Bergen County Audubon Society) who told us the scopes were aimed at a Bald Eagle nest in the distance. Apparently, Bald Eagles often ignore man-made nests (unlike Ospreys who depend on them), and instead choose to make their own nests. The nest looked like a very large squirrel nest.</p> <p>We decided to explore the area and we saw some Double-crested Cormorants and Ring-billed Gulls. However, it was very cold and windy out so we went indoors where different organizations had tables set up with information and merch. My sister and I each bought a hat to support the NJ Plover Project and Bergen County Audubon Society and made some donations to others. We found out about a maple tree tapping event among others and got recommended to take the Osprey boating tours in Cape May during Spring migration.</p> <p>Later, there was a presentation indoors led by the BCAS President on Bald Eagles. I learned that in 1970, there was only 1 Bald Eagle nest in NJ but they have since made a huge comeback. The banning of a pesticide called DDT in 1972 played a huge role in this. Without that ban among other efforts, there was a good chance we would never see Bald Eagles in NJ. I felt very lucky to have already seen several bald eagles (including one just 5 minutes from my house that flew over my head at Rahway River Park).</p> <p>After the festival (and eating at Soup Dumpling Plus), my sister and I decided to check out one of the nearby birding locations that someone at the festival recommended to us, Richard W. DeKorte Park. This park has walking trails that go over part of the Hackensack River that is more landlocked near the NJ Turnpike. You also get a great view of Manhattan from here (even better than the view of Brooklyn from Sandy Hook). Despite being near a busy highway and the city, the area feels fairly secluded and has many varieties of water fowl.</p> <p>We did not stay too long because of the cold winds but we came back the next day to explore the park further. During our time there we saw four new waterfowl including Common Merganser, Gadwall, Northern Pintail, and Bufflehead. The Buffleheads were far from the walking paths and difficult to photograph but they could be seen diving down for food and re-emerging an impressive 30 seconds later. The Gadwall looks similar to the Mallard Duck but the males make a hilarious MEEP sound.</p> <p>I will definitely attend next year's Bald Eagle Festival and return to DeKorte Park for birding. I already signed up for the maple tree tapping and will sign up for Osprey boating tours at Cape May. </p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-01/2023-01-16/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/River-Barge-Park-NJ</p> <ul> <li>Red-winged Blackbird</li> <li>European Starling</li> <li>Mourning Dove</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Ring-billed Gull</li> <li>Canada Goose</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>American Black Duck</li> <li>Herring Gull</li> <li>Double-crested Cormorant</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/Richard-W-DeKorte-Park-NJ</p> <ul> <li>Gadwall</li> <li>Northern Pintail</li> <li>Bufflehead</li> <li>Common Merganser</li> <li>Northern Shoveler</li> <li>Mallard Duck</li> <li>American Black Duck</li> <li>Snow Goose</li> <li>Canada Goose</li> <li>Black-capped Chickadee</li> <li>Red-winged Blackbird</li> <li>Tufted Titmouse</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Mourning Dove</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>Ring-billed Gull</li> <li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-02/2023-02-20/","title":"2023 02 20","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-02/2023-02-20/#woodcocks-at-bryant-park","title":"Woodcocks at Bryant Park","text":"<p>2023-02-20</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>On this warm President's Day, my sister and I decided to go to Bryant Park in NYC in search of American Woodcocks, also known as timberdoodles. Last summer, we discovered Woodcocks and their hilarious bobbing behavior while watching funny YouTube videos, where one can see them bob to music . We immediately checked where Woodcocks could be found in our area and, to our surprise, discovered that they could be seen at Bryant Park in NYC. Apparently, birders know this park as \"Doodletown\" because the migratory bird arrives in large numbers starting in March. We decided that this warm winter day (~60 degrees) was the perfect time to visit. We also checked eBird the day before to confirm recent Woodcocks sightings at the park.</p> <p>When we arrived at Bryant Park, we were surprised to see the Winter Shops and Ice Skating Rink were still set up from the holiday season. We were worried that the shops and rink would disrupt the Woodcocks since it covered a lot of the grass patches. We walked around the park inspecting each of the patches of grass and leaves between the paths and benches. After about 20 minutes, we were ready to give up but then my sister noticed people with large camera lenses staring at a bush (always a good sign for birding). When we approached them, they told us there was a Woodcock in the bush and guided us on spotting them.</p> <p>Apparently, the Woodcock had been there since 8am (it was about noon at this point) and was only out of the bush for a short while. It was not hard to believe considering we watched the Woodcock for almost an hour and it just blinked and bobbed a bit in the same spot. Even when a noisy Gray Catbird landed near the Woodcock, it remained still. Luckily, the Woodcock was mostly visible from certain angles and I was able to get photos. We decided to get some Bao Buns from a stand at the Winter Shops before going to a nearby thrift store. </p> <p>After the thrift store, we stopped by Bryant Park again to check on the Woodcock. To our surprise it did move, but no more than a few feet from its previous location. This new spot was lit nicely by the afternoon sun being reflected off a nearby skyscraper and I was able to get better photos. We were very grateful to have seen a Woodcock today and add a new bird to our list. We will definitely return to Bryant Park in the coming month to visit the Woodcocks again (and hopefully they will be more active).</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-02/2023-02-20/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/BryantPark-NYC</p> <ul> <li>American Woodcock</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>White-throated Sparrow</li> <li>Gray Catbird</li> <li>Common Grackle</li> <li>European Starling</li> <li>Rock Pigeon</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-03/2023-03-05/","title":"2023 03 05","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-03/2023-03-05/#sunny-florida-adventures","title":"Sunny Florida Adventures","text":"<p>2023-03-05</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>Link to full OneDrive Photo Album</p> <p>This week I went to Florida to go to Okeechobee Music Festival with my cousin who lives nearby in St. Petersburg. I decided to go two days early before the festival started so I could explore the area and go hiking/birding with my cousin. This was my first time going to Florida so I was very excited. The night before my flight, there was the first major snowfall of the year in New Jersey (~4 inches) and I was up until 1am making a massive snowman with my sister. It was interesting having the plane de-iced before the flight only to land into sunny, 80-degree weather in under 3 hours.</p> <p>My first new bird encounter was certainly unexpected. Outside the USF campus gym where my cousin and I rented the camping equipment for the music festival, there was a Muscovy Duck guarding her eggs in a bush. I'm glad I decided to bring both my large Sony 200-600 and compact 70-350 birding lenses so I always had one or the other on hand.</p> <p>After getting the camping gear, we headed to Lettuce Lake. This park had a similar setup as the Great Swamp Refuge in NJ in that it has observation platforms and paths that take you through the area via elevated boardwalks. This lets you get close to the wildlife without walking in swamp/marsh. I was immediately greeted by the sound of a new warbler high in the tree canopy that ended up being a Northern Parula. Here we saw alligators, a flock of White Ibises nesting in trees and washing off in the marsh, and a Little Blue Heron hunting for fish among other things. I also met others photographers and birders that were interested in my Sony 200-600 (should have given them an affiliate link haha).</p> <p>Later that same day, we went to Violet Cury Nature Preserve where my cousin would often take his dog on walks after work/class. This location was more lowkey than the previous with few people and no boardwalks, just paths. Here I saw another Little Blue Heron fishing in the lake, a male Muscovy Duck swimming, a Barred Owl, as well as my first of many lizards on this trip. Near the lake, we saw American Coots and a flock of Ring-necked Ducks. I also got to see drastically different vegetation than back in NJ including air plants all over the ground, Spanish moss, an air potato, and loads of interesting flowers.</p> <p>That night, I met two of my cousin's friends and we went out to experience the St. Pete nightlife. From a cozy bar setup like a living room with video games and ping pong to a bar with live music and someone playing guitar riff with their tongue, it was an awesome experience. We ended the night by visiting an abandoned community food farm where one can supposedly grab food as needed. My cousin and his friends were using their knowledge of plants to identify each plant in the community farm and we even found a mini-fridge full of tiny frogs huddling around the cool air.</p> <p>After an eventful first day, we got about 4 hours of sleep (common theme on this trip) so we could wake up early and experience a Florida sunrise and it was well worth it. We got to the St. Pete side of Tampa Bay just as sunrise was starting. The water was warm and shallow until a dip before a sandbar in the distance where a Great Blue Heron and various sandpipers/plovers including Willet, Sanderling, Least Sandpiper, and Black-bellied Plover were catching their breakfast. As the sun rose above the horizon, the massive ball of fire lit the sky red and made a beautiful reflection on the water. Some of my favorite shots of the trip were the silhouettes of sandpipers feeding between me and the ball of fire in the sky.</p> <p>After the breathtaking sunrise, we headed to Fort DeSoto, several lengths of beach at the southern tip of St. Pete, for more hiking, birding, and kayaking. This is one location I read about even before arriving in Florida since it's well known to birders. Here is where I got most of my photos of new birds including Brown Pelicans plunge-diving for food, Royal Terns, Forster's Terns and Black Skimmers claiming their territory, the endangered Piping Plovers and Ruddy Turnstones foraging for food, and the absolutely breathtaking Reddish Egret's foraging dance and charge. The Reddish Egret's dance was one of the most fascinating and hilarious acts I have ever seen a bird perform. It would race back and forth in the shallow water while opening and shutting its wings. It sometimes looked like a dinosaur doing an all-out charge and other times like a graceful dancer. Apparently, they do this to stir up sediment in pursuit of small fish. </p> <p>After exploring the beaches of Fort DeSoto, we rented a kayak and I switched to my more compact Sony 70-350 lens. Here we saw beautiful mangrove trees that housed a Little Blue Heron, Yellow-crowned Night-Heron, and White Ibis. There was no shortage of aquatic life including conches, sea cucumbers, sponges, and sea anemones. We were also glad to see and photograph a Manatee just before returning the kayak, a must-see sea creature for anyone visiting Florida. After the kayaking, we ended the visit to Fort DeSoto by checking out the boat launch were one birder we met mentioned there baby Great Horned Owls nesting. Immediately after parking the car, we saw the babies atop a palm tree cuddled for warmth with nearby Osprey nests. My cousin was able to find the parent Great Horned Owl in nearby trees.</p> <p>The rest of our day was spent preparing for the music festival. I didn't bring my camera to the festival but I still managed to get a picture of a new bird, the Sandhill Crane, using my phone camera (there's always time for birding haha). I was blown away by everything I saw in just 2 days of exploring Florida and Okeechobee Music Festival was one of the best experiences of my life. It's always an adventure hanging out with my cousin and I can't wait for the next one! </p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-03/2023-03-05/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/USFCampus-StPetersburg-Florida </p> <ul> <li>Muscovy Duck</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/LettuceLake-StPetersburg-Florida</p> <ul> <li>Carolina Wren</li> <li>Northern Parula</li> <li>White Ibis</li> <li>Little Blue Heron</li> <li>Downy Woodpecker</li> <li>Hairy Woodpecker</li> <li>American Robin</li> <li>Mourning Dove</li> <li>Osprey</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> <li>Northern Cardinal</li> <li>Blue Jay</li> <li>Common Grackle</li> <li>American Crow</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/VioletCuryNaturePreserve-StPetersburg-Florida</p> <ul> <li>Muscovy Duck</li> <li>American Coot</li> <li>Ring-necked Duck</li> <li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li> <li>Little Blue Heron</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/TampaBay-StPetersburg-Florida</p> <ul> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> <li>White Ibis</li> <li>Black-bellied Plover</li> <li>Willet</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/FortDeSoto-StPetersburg-Florida</p> <ul> <li>Brown Pelican</li> <li>Black-bellied Plover</li> <li>Royal Tern</li> <li>Forster's Tern</li> <li>Reddish Egret</li> <li>Ruddy Turnstone</li> <li>Laughing Gull</li> <li>Willet</li> <li>Yellow-crowned Night-Heron</li> <li>Little Blue Heron</li> <li>Piping Plover</li> <li>Black Skimmer</li> <li>Snowy Egret</li> <li>White Ibis</li> <li>Semipalmated Plover</li> <li>Sanderling</li> <li>Laughing Gull</li> <li>Ring-billed Gull</li> <li>Double-crested Cormorant</li> <li>Osprey</li> <li>Ruby-crowned Kinglet</li> <li>Great Horned Owl</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/Okeechobee-Florida</p> <ul> <li>Sandhill Crane</li> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>Turkey Vulture</li> <li>Red-Tailed Hawk</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-05/2023-05-28/","title":"2023 05 28","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-05/2023-05-28/#osprey-boating-tour","title":"Osprey Boating Tour","text":"<p>2023-06-01</p> <p>[[SpecificLinkToBlogHere|&lt; Back to Blog Home]]</p> <p>Some Text Here</p> <p>Next Paragraph here</p> <ul> <li>Location, parking, crowd age</li> <li>Super windy on boat</li> <li>Ruddy turnstone</li> <li>terns diving for fish</li> <li>Boat-tailed grack</li> <li>Spotted Pipers in the much</li> <li>Dowitcher orange belly, show photo to others</li> <li>Met someone who sent bird compendium and camera gear rec to</li> <li>Oyster catchers babies second time around</li> <li>Photo of rope LOL thinking it was babies</li> <li>Night heron</li> <li>bald eagle nest</li> <li>snowy egret</li> <li>So many ospreys (boat name haha)</li> <li>Loon, horror movie link</li> <li>Lesser scaup left behind migration</li> <li>Rail in bushses</li> <li>Tern nests</li> <li>Lobster roll</li> <li>Near accident</li> <li>KoreanBBQ</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-05/2023-05-28/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/Missing</p> <ul> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; #location/Missing</p> <ul> <li>Song Sparrow</li> <li>House Sparrow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-11/2023-11-25/","title":"2023 11 25","text":""},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-11/2023-11-25/#prone-for-cooper","title":"Prone for Cooper","text":"<p>2023-11-25</p> <p>&lt; Back to Blog Home</p> <p> </p> <p>Link to full OneDrive Photo Album</p> <p>After 6 months with no blog post, I will be sharing a Cooper's Hawk encounter in my backyard. For the past few weeks, there's been a hawk stalking our bird feeder at least once a day (hawks have to eat too). Usually, it will hang out below flower bushes where it can see the bird feeder but stay relatively out of sight.</p> <p>Based on the size, we decided it was a Cooper's Hawk instead of the very similar Sharp-shinned Hawk. Cooper's Hawks tend to be about the size of a American Crow, while Sharp-shinned Hawks are about the size of a Blue Jay. Otherwise, they are almost identical and often hard to differentiate.</p> <p>The hawk tends to come later in the day when the sun would no longer illuminate my yard, making photographs difficult. Today, the hawk came early in the morning and stood where the sun was just shining over my house. I decided to take this opportunity to get a photo of the hawk while it hunted. </p> <p>The best angle for photos is usually to be eye-level with the bird and since this was a short hawk, my best option was to crawl prone across my yard and hope it did not spot me. The mornings are already cold enough that the grass is covered in frost so this meant I was essentially crawling across a giant ice cube that soaked my clothing through. Despite looking in my direction several times, the hawk either did not see me or ignored me. At one point I thought it was going to go for a Dark-eyed Junco that landed nearby but it just gave it a mean stare and never pounced on it. After about 20 minutes, the hawk leaped from the ground onto our fence and soon after flew away. That was the closest I have ever gotten to a hawk with a good angle for photographs. It was worth crawling across a giant ice cube in almost-freezing weather to have this experience.</p>"},{"location":"Blog%20Archive/2023-11/2023-11-25/#locationssightings","title":"Locations/Sightings","text":"<p>-&gt; #location/Home-Clark-NJ </p> <ul> <li>Cooper's Hawk</li> <li>Dark-eyed Junco</li> </ul>"}]}
